Work Projects Download Creator
==============================

Work Projects Download Creator is a simple application that prepares a download folder containing all CodeUnit projects for uploading to a webserver. It basically collects all files residing in the release folder of CodeUnit projects as well as the description, screenshot and build version files held in the project base folder. These harvested files are dumped into a generated Download folder and the project details and download links are all added to a generated html page. Once completed, this download folder can then be moved as is straight to a webserver.
